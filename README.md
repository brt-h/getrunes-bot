# getrunes-bot
A work-in-progress discord bot to remind you to get the runes every 5 minutes, currently availible as a webapp at www.getrunes.com (https://github.com/tkcarnage/getrunes)

You are required to create a file in the project directory called config.json,
containing your bot private token in this format:
{
  "token"  : "private-token-goes-here"
}
